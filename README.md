# SpaceShooterGame
A Unity game using C#, made with the help from Jonathan Weinberger's "The Ultimate Guide to Game Development with Unity 2019" as well as fellow developer Christian Serrano (serranc1 on GitHub).
Sprites are from GameDevHQ.
The game works, but can be updated with more menu options, briefing, and controls.
